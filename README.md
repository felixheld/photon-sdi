         An open source SDI core
              powered by LiteX

## Intro

photonSDI provides an open source SDI core.

Since Python is used to describe the HDL, the core is highly and easily
configurable.

photonSDI is built using LiteX and uses technologies developed in partnership with
M-Labs Ltd:
 - Migen enables generating HDL with Python in an efficient way.
 - MiSoC provides the basic blocks to build a powerful and small footprint SoC.

photonSDI can be used as LiteX library or can be integrated with your standard
design flow by generating the verilog rtl that you will use as a standard core.

## Features

- None

## Possible improvements

- Lots

## Getting started

1. Install Python3 and your vendor's software

2. Obtain LiteX and install it:

  git clone https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex --recursive
  cd litex
  python3 setup.py install
  cd ..

 * [IRC Channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/#photonsdi) ([Web version](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#photonsdi,#m-labs,#timvideos,#apertus))

We love open-source hardware and like sharing our designs with others.

photonSDI is developed and maintained by Felix Held for the
[TimVideos](https://code.timvideos.us) & [Apertus](https://apertus.org/)
project.

If you would like to know more about photonSDI or if you are already a happy
